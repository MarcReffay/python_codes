2. Codingame spring challenge 2022
This project is a solution of the spring challenge from Codingame introduced here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyHjWftmMfQ
It is a really defensive solution, based on not losing life and win the game by getting many mana, which is the way to win in case none of the players has lost all his lives at the end of a given number of turns
It can really be approved by defining for example an offensive hero that will guide spiders to the other player's base to make him lose lives but this better solution is not implemented here
The solution introduced is effective in silver league but could not lead to gold league
